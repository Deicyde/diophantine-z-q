# The pushout of two open immersions out of a common scheme

Mathlib's locally directed glueing makes `CategoryTheory.Limits.pushout f₁ f₂` exist for *any* two
open immersions `f₁ : Z ⟶ X` and `f₂ : Z ⟶ Y` out of a common scheme, with no glueing datum, no
cocycle condition and no hypothesis beyond the two open immersions.  This file records the two
facts that let that pushout be used as the glueing of `X` and `Y` along `Z`: its two legs cover it,
and they meet exactly in the image of `Z`.

Both are read off the locally directed colimit API of `Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/Gluing.lean`:
`pushout f₁ f₂` is the colimit of `CategoryTheory.Limits.span f₁ f₂`, a diagram of open immersions
over the three-object index category `CategoryTheory.Limits.WalkingSpan`, and the colimit of such a
diagram is covered by the images of its objects
(`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.IsLocallyDirected.ι_jointly_surjective`) with two points identified in
it exactly when they are already identified somewhere in the diagram
(`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.IsLocallyDirected.ι_eq_ι_iff`).

## Main results

* `AlgebraicGeometry.opensRange_pushout_inl_sup_inr`: the two legs of the pushout cover it.
* `AlgebraicGeometry.opensRange_pushout_inl_inf_inr`: the two legs meet exactly in the image of the
  common source.

## Implementation notes

That the two legs are open immersions needs no statement here.  `CategoryTheory.Limits.pushout.inl`
is a reducible abbreviation for `CategoryTheory.Limits.colimit.ι`, so Mathlib's instance
`IsOpenImmersion (colimit.ι F i)` for a locally directed diagram `F` of open immersions already
fires on `pushout.inl f₁ f₂` and `pushout.inr f₁ f₂` by `inferInstance`.

The `⊓` computation uses that `CategoryTheory.Limits.WalkingSpan` has *no* morphism between its two
outer objects: a point of the pushout lying in both legs is therefore identified in the diagram
over the central object, where the two structure morphisms are `f₁` and `f₂`.
