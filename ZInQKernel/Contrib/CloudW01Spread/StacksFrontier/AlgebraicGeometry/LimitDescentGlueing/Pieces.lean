# Descending the affine pieces of a scheme of finite presentation over a limit

Let `S = lim Sᵢ` be a cofiltered limit of quasi-compact, quasi-separated schemes with affine
transition morphisms, and let `X` be a quasi-compact scheme locally of finite presentation over
`S`.  This file descends the *affine pieces* of `X`: it produces a single stage `Sᵢ`, a finite
affine open cover of `X`, and for every member of that cover an affine scheme of finite
presentation over an affine open of `Sᵢ` whose base change to `S` is that member.

This is the first half of the source's proof of the essential-surjectivity half of Stacks Tag 0EY1,
equivalently of Stacks Tag 01ZM part (1).  The second half — descending the intersections of the
members of the cover, the identifications between the two descents of each intersection, and the
glueing itself — is not in this file, so neither tag is attached here; it is carried out in
`StacksFrontier.AlgebraicGeometry.LimitDescentGlueing.Glueing`, which proves both tags.

Only quasi-separatedness of the stages is used, not their quasi-compactness: the source deduces
that `X` is quasi-compact from the quasi-compactness of `S`, while here quasi-compactness of `X` is
a hypothesis.

## Main results

* `AlgebraicGeometry.exists_isPullback_of_isAffine_of_isAffineOpen`: the affine case of Tag 01ZM
  part (1) over **quasi-separated** stages: an affine scheme locally of finite presentation over
  `S` whose image lies in an affine open of `S` is the base change of an affine scheme of finite
  presentation over an affine open of a stage.  This removes the affineness of the stages, the
  hypothesis `∀ i, IsAffine (D.obj i)` of
  `AlgebraicGeometry.exists_isPullback_of_isAffine_of_isLimit`.
* `AlgebraicGeometry.exists_finite_isAffineOpen_cover`: a morphism with quasi-compact source
  admits a finite affine open cover of its source each member of which maps into an affine open of
  its target, as a family of `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Opens`.
* `AlgebraicGeometry.exists_isPullback_baseChange_of_isAffineOpen`: a model over an affine open of
  a stage can be transported to any later stage.
* `AlgebraicGeometry.LimitDescent.exists_stage_isAffineModels`: the main result, as described
  above: all the affine pieces of `X` descend to **one** stage.
* `AlgebraicGeometry.exists_isPullback_of_isOpen_baseChange`: a quasi-compact open of a base
  change `S ×_{Sᵢ} Z` is itself the base change of a quasi-compact open of `S_j ×_{Sᵢ} Z` for some
  later stage `j`.  This is Tag 01Z4 (1) in the relative form the glueing step needs.
* `AlgebraicGeometry.baseChangeTransition_fst_isPullback`: the square comparing the base changes
  of a scheme over `S` to two stages is a pullback square over the transition morphism of the
  stages; a companion of `AlgebraicGeometry.baseChangeTransition_isPullback`.

## Implementation notes

The affine case over quasi-separated stages is obtained from the affine case over affine stages by
running the latter on Mathlib's `AlgebraicGeometry.opensDiagram`, the diagram of the preimages of
an affine open `Vᵢ ⊆ Sᵢ` in the later stages, whose limit is the preimage of `Vᵢ` in `S` by
`AlgebraicGeometry.isLimitOpensCone`.  Its index category is `CategoryTheory.Over i`, which is in
the scheme universe exactly when the index category is, so the result is stated for `I : Type u`
with `Category.{u} I`; that is also the shape in which it is used by
`AlgebraicGeometry.LimitDescent.HasFinitePresentationModels`.

Each model is produced over an affine open `Vᵢ` of its stage rather than over the stage itself.
This is what makes the models transportable: the base change of the model along a transition
morphism `D.map a` is a pullback of affine schemes over the affine scheme `Vᵢ`, because `D.map a`
is affine and so `D.map a ⁻¹ᵁ Vᵢ` is affine again.  Over the stage itself the same base change
need not be affine.

## What the glueing adds

The source glues the whole cover at once, against a glueing datum indexed by pairs.  Two Mathlib
results make glueing *two* pieces at a time cheaper, and reduce Tag 01ZM part (1) to an induction
on the size of the cover:

* `CategoryTheory.Limits.HasPushout` holds for any two open immersions out of a common scheme, and
  the two maps into the pushout are open immersions covering it — this is Mathlib's
  `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.IsLocallyDirected` colimit, which applies to `span i₁ i₂` as soon as
  `i₁` and `i₂` are open immersions.  So no glueing datum, no `t'` and no cocycle condition is
  needed: the glued scheme is `pushout i₁ i₂`.
* `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.isPullback_of_openCover` says that a commuting square of schemes is a
  pullback square as soon as it is one after restricting along an open cover of its upper-right
  corner.  Applied to the cover of the glued scheme by its two pieces, this identifies the base
  change of the glued scheme with `X` without any statement that base change preserves the glueing
  colimit — which is just as well, since base change is a right adjoint and the library says
  nothing of the kind.

The induction is on the number of members of the cover, over the statement "a quasi-compact,
quasi-separated `X` of finite presentation over `S` covered by `n` opens each of which is the base
change of a scheme of finite presentation over a stage is itself such a base change".  The step
splits `X` as `A ∪ B` with `A` the union of the first `n - 1` members and `B` the last; `A ⊓ B` is
a quasi-compact open of `B`, so it descends by
`AlgebraicGeometry.exists_isPullback_of_isOpen_baseChange` — which is why the count does not grow
and the induction closes, where an induction over *affine* covers would not.  The uniqueness of a
descent up to a later stage, which identifies the two descents of `A ⊓ B`, is
`AlgebraicGeometry.exists_iso_of_isPullback_of_isPullback`, obtained from Tag 01ZM part (2) and
Tag 081E.

All of this is carried out in `StacksFrontier.AlgebraicGeometry.LimitDescentGlueing.Glueing`.

/-- **The affine case of Stacks Tag 01ZM part (1) over quasi-separated stages.**

Let `S = lim Sᵢ` be a cofiltered limit of quasi-separated schemes with affine transition morphisms
and let `X` be an affine scheme locally of finite presentation over `S` whose image lies in an
affine open `V ⊆ S`.  Then `X` is the base change of an affine scheme locally of finite
presentation over an affine open `Vᵢ` of one of the stages, and `V` is the preimage of `Vᵢ`.

The stages themselves are *not* assumed affine, which is what distinguishes this from
`AlgebraicGeometry.exists_isPullback_of_isAffine_of_isLimit`; the affine open `V` of the limit is
descended first, by Tag 01Z4 (1), and the affine case over affine stages is then applied to the
diagram of its preimages in the later stages. -/

/-! ### All the affine pieces at one stage -/

/-- **The affine pieces of a scheme of finite presentation over a cofiltered limit descend to a
single stage.**

Let `S = lim Sᵢ` be a cofiltered limit of quasi-separated schemes with affine transition
morphisms, and let `X` be a quasi-compact scheme locally of finite presentation over `S`.  Then
there is one stage `i`, a finite affine open cover `U` of `X`, affine opens `V k ⊆ S` and
`Vᵢ k ⊆ Sᵢ` with `V k` the preimage of `Vᵢ k`, and affine schemes `Xᵢ k` locally of finite
presentation over `Vᵢ k`, such that each `U k` is the base change of `Xᵢ k` to `S`.

This is the first half of the source's proof of the essential-surjectivity half of Stacks Tag 0EY1
(equivalently of Tag 01ZM part (1)); the glueing of the pieces is carried out in
`StacksFrontier.AlgebraicGeometry.LimitDescentGlueing.Glueing`, where the tag is attached. -/
