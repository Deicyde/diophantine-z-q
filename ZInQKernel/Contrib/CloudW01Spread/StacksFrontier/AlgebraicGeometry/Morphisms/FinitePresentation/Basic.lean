# Permanence of finite presentation

For a composable pair of morphisms of schemes, local finite presentation of the composite
descends to the first morphism when the second is locally of finite type. If the composite is
of finite presentation and the second morphism is also quasi-separated, then the first
morphism is of finite presentation.

## Main results

* `AlgebraicGeometry.locallyOfFinitePresentation_of_comp` proves the local assertion.
* `AlgebraicGeometry.finitePresentation_of_comp` proves the global assertion.

## Implementation notes

The structure morphism from the source scheme to the base is represented by the composite of
the two displayed morphisms. The two independent assertions in the source are stated as
separate lemmas. The local finite-presentation and finite-type conditions use Mathlib's
morphism-property classes.

The descent along a composite is isolated as a general statement about a pair of
`HasRingHomProperty` morphism properties: it reduces to the affine case by three successive
Zariski localizations, at the base, at the intermediate scheme, and at the source.
